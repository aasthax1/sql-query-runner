OVERVIEW

SQL Runner is a web-based application that allows users to input and execute SQL queries while displaying the results in a structured table format. It provides a simple UI with a dropdown/toggle to switch between predefined queries and their respective outputs.

This is a dummy application, meaning the queries do not actually run on a backend, but the app mimics an SQL execution environment for better user experience.
